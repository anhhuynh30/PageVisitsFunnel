# Page Visits Funnel

In this project, I will analyze **Cool T-Shirts Inc.**'s data on visits to their website. My main task is to build a **funnel**, which is a description of how many people continue to the next step of a multi-step process.

The following is **Cool T-Shirts Inc.**'s funnel process:

1. A user visits CoolTShirts.com
2. A user adds a t-shirt to their cart
3. A user clicks “checkout”
4. A user actually purchases a t-shirt

There are **4** DataFrames that are used in this project:

- **visit** lists all of the users who have visited the website
- **cart** lists all of the users who have added a t-shirt to their cart
- **checkout** lists all of the users who have started the checkout
- **purchase** lists all of the users who have purchased a t-shirt

This project is a part of my study in Codecademy's Data Scientist: Analytics Specialist learning path.
